* Game release. Hooray!
<br>
<br>
* Added a setting to adjust the speed of movement
<br>
  when holding down SHIFT (or other key you'd bound)
<br>
<br>
Before reporting any problems, please make sure you've seen
<br>
the tutorial (spawn in & press T). If you have, and you can't
<br>
move with WASD or press SHIFT, go to settings (ESC by default),
<br>
scroll down, and change the keybinds to your liking, then try again.
